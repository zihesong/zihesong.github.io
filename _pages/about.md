I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, advised by Prof. Wei Yang.
My research lies at the intersection of **large language models (LLMs)**, **mobile systems**, and **software testing**.

I build **LLM-driven agents** and **automation frameworks** that can understand and interact with complex user interfaces:
they explore apps, reason about ambiguous user goals, and generate robust test executions at scale. My work combines
program analysis, UI modeling, and multimodal interaction to make intelligent systems more **reliable, efficient, and usable**.

My research has led to systems for:

- **Parallel mobile UI testing** that improves coverage, time, and crash detection (TAOPT, ASPLOS 2025).
- **LLM-based UI exploration frameworks** that learn to navigate and test real apps (Guardian, ISSTA 2024).
- **Automatic repair of flaky or inefficient test behaviors** in large industrial settings (WEFix, WWW 2024).
- **Efficiency and robustness evaluation for modern ML systems**, including neural machine translation and image captioning (NICGSlowDown, CVPR 2022; NMTSloth, ESEC/FSE 2022).

I am broadly interested in:

- LLM agents for **UI navigation, accessibility, and debugging**
- Testing and evaluation for **interactive AI systems**
- Large-scale **benchmarking and automation** for mobile apps and tools
- Robustness, efficiency, and reliability of deployed ML systems

When I am not doing research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring students, and working on course design.
I also like tennis, skiing, and experimenting with new recipes.


## 🔍 Job Market

I am currently on the 2026 job market and open to opportunities in AI/ML, intelligent systems,
LLM agents, and software engineering research. I welcome conversations with teams working on
cutting-edge interaction systems, evaluation, and agentic workflows.
Feel free to reach out at 📧 **zihe.song@utdallas.edu** if you believe there might be a fit.
