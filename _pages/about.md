Projects
======

    
* Santander Customer Transaction Prediction : Mar. 2019 - Apr. 2019 <br> 
        _Primary language: Python_
  * Created binary classification models based on Light GBM, GNB and SVM algorithms to predict whether the customer will make a transaction with Santander.
  * The dataset contains 200 numerical features and 200,000 instances, the AUC of LGBM
model is up to 0.90.

        _Primary language: Python_
  * Wrote code to implement face and blink recognition on real-time photo based on Viola-Jones Algorithm.
  * The detection accuracy is up to 85%.
  
  
* ERC20 Token Transactions Analysis : Nov. 2018 - Dec. 2018 <br> 
        _Primary language: R_
  * Worked with another team member to create discrete distribution models for an ERC20 Token.
  * Analyzed the correlation between number of transactions and price, amount, transaction party, etc.


* Unix V6 File System : Nov. 2018 - Dec. 2018<br> 
        _Primary language: C_
