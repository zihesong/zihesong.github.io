Address. Contacts. Motto. Etc.</p> <p>profile: align: right image: prof_pic.jpg image_circular: false # crops the image to make it circular</p> <p>I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, advised by Prof. Wei Yang. My research lies at the intersection of <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>, <strong>mobile systems</strong>, and <strong>software testing</strong>.</p> <p>I build <strong>LLM-driven agents</strong> and <strong>automation frameworks</strong> that can understand and interact with complex user interfaces: they explore apps, reason about ambiguous user goals, and generate robust test executions at scale. My work combines program analysis, UI modeling, and multimodal interaction to make intelligent systems more <strong>reliable, efficient, and usable</strong>.</p> <p>My research has led to systems for:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Parallel mobile UI testing</strong> that improves coverage, time, and crash detection (TAOPT, ASPLOS 2025).</li> <li> <strong>LLM-based UI exploration frameworks</strong> that learn to navigate and test real apps (Guardian, ISSTA 2024).</li> <li> <strong>Automatic repair of flaky or inefficient test behaviors</strong> in large industrial settings (WEFix, WWW 2024).</li> <li> <strong>Efficiency and robustness evaluation for modern ML systems</strong>, including neural machine translation and image captioning (NICGSlowDown, CVPR 2022; NMTSloth, ESEC/FSE 2022).</li> </ul> <p>I am broadly interested in:</p> <ul> <li>LLM agents for <strong>UI navigation, accessibility, and debugging</strong> </li> <li>Testing and evaluation for <strong>interactive AI systems</strong> </li> <li>Large-scale <strong>benchmarking and automation</strong> for mobile apps and tools</li> <li>Robustness, efficiency, and reliability of deployed ML systems</li> </ul> <p>When I am not doing research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring students, and working on course design. I also like tennis, skiing, and experimenting with new recipes.</p> <h2 id="-job-market">🔍 Job Market</h2> <p>I am currently on the 2026 job market and open to opportunities in AI/ML, intelligent systems, LLM agents, and software engineering research. I welcome conversations with teams working on cutting-edge interaction systems, evaluation, and agentic workflows. Feel free to reach out at 📧 <strong>zihe.song@utdallas.edu</strong> if you believe there might be a fit.</p> </body></html>
